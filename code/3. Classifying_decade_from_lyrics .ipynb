    "**2010:** This decade shows the highest F1-Score, indicating the best classification performance, likely due to more distinctive lyrical features and potentially larger representation in the dataset.\n",

    "Overall Accuracy: Increased slightly from 0.29 to 0.30 after hyperparameter tuning, which is not a significant improvement.\n",
    "Macro vs. Weighted Avg: The macro average remains the same, but the weighted average F1-Score shows a slight improvement. This suggests that while the model's performance improved for the most frequent classes, the less frequent classes still pose a challenge.\n",
