    "**Blues** - The F1-score slightly decreased after tuning, indicating a marginal drop in balanced performance between precision and recall. Precision increased slightly, but recall decreased, meaning the model was better at identifying true blues songs but missed more blues songs overall.\n",

    "**Country** - Both recall and F1-score slightly decreased after tuning, but precision remained the same. The model was better at identifying true country songs before tuning.\n",

    "**Hip Hop** - Precision increased slightly after tuning, but recall decreased. The F1-score remained the same. The model became more precise but less capable of identifying all true hip hop songs.\n",

    "**Jazz** - The F1-score improved after tuning, indicating better balanced performance between precision and recall. The model improved in identifying true jazz songs.\n",

    "**Pop** - The F1-score and recall both improved after tuning, showing that the model became better at identifying true pop songs and predicting pop songs correctly.\n",

    "**Reggae** - The F1-score improved, indicating better balanced performance. Both precision and recall increased, showing overall improvement in identifying and predicting reggae songs.\n",

    "\n",
    "Accuracy remained the same at 0.42 before and after tuning however macro average precision and F1-score slightly improved, indicating that the model's performance across all genres improved in terms of balanced performance between precision and recall. The weighted average metrics remained the same, indicating no significant change in overall performance for the majority class.\n",
    "Conclusion\n",
    "The hyperparameter tuning resulted in slight improvements for some genres, particularly pop and reggae, while others like blues and country saw slight decreases in performance. The overall accuracy remained unchanged, suggesting that while tuning helped specific classes, it did not significantly impact the overall model performance. The balanced performance (F1-score) across all genres saw a marginal improvement, indicating the model became slightly better at handling the imbalanced class distribution."
